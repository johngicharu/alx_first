        <h2>Personal Mission</h2>
        <p class="personal_mission">
          I have always believed that technology is the key to changing our society and transforming it for the better. I believe that fostering wider adoption of technology across the board and encouraging younger individuals to adopt technology and hone their technological skills is vital for the eradication of critical issues facing our society. I believe that a school dropout with some knowledge on coding, programming or other worthwhile ventures in technology can have a bigger and potentially positive impact in society as opposed to one who only got basic knowledge in school in Mathematics, English and the Sciences. As such, it is my personal mission to create solutions that will help teach young children and other members of society programming and partner with other professionals in tech to impart this knowledge earlier on in a simplified manner to help society grow as a whole. These strategies will create a generation that is more atuned to developments across the globe and are well equipped in as far as changing society and causing dramatic and huge strides towards the continent being recognized as a leader in technology, economics among other factors.

        <h2>Community Impact</h2>
        <p class="impacting_the_community">
          Also aligned with my personal mission when learning programming and software development is to impact society by causing gradual shifts in society in areas such as poverty eradication especially among physically disabled members of the society. I consider programming as a useful skillset that can not only be performed by children but can also be honed as a skill for many handicapped individuals who would otherwise go out begging for financial aid. However, with a skill that is in demand, many of these individuals can acquire a marketable skill which they can work on remotely thereby not demanding a lot with regard to physical effort. Dependence on aid is a widespread problem in the continent and in my country. However, I believe that with programming, all this can be changed one step and industry at a time.

        <h2>Venture</h2>
        <p class="venture_created">
          While I currently do not have any personal venture, I have several plans to develop different applications aimed at expanding the adoption of programming in society as a whole. I firmly believe that programming is an essential skill that everyone should have under their belt. As such, I aim to work hard to ensure that everyone not only learns it, but can also easily perceive various areas of their lives where they can apply it allowing for automation of most of the mundane tasks we engage in.

        <h2>Audacious Me <span class="emoji">ðŸ˜‚</span></h2>
        <p class="audacious_goals">
          I have the audicious goal of transforming the continent, begining with my own country Kenya into a technologically advanced society that in unencumbered with challenges such as poverty and issues such as disability are a thing of the past. I firmly believe that by educating the young ones, we are preparing the continent for the next generation of world leaders who will be born in our continent and serve to push it forward placing it at the front of society as opposed to being at its tail end.
